# ðŸš¨ Sahayak AI - Your Emergency Co-pilot

Sahayak AI is a Chrome Extension built for the Google AI Hackathon. It acts as an intelligent, life-saving co-pilot that provides clear, step-by-step guidance during any emergency.

## Problem It Solves
During an emergency (like a fire, earthquake, or medical issue), people panic. They forget simple life-saving steps. Sahayak AI provides instant, calm, and actionable instructions directly in their browser.

## Features
-   **Instant AI Guidance:** Get clear, step-by-step instructions for any situation.
-   **Context-Aware:** The AI is trained (via prompts) to identify available resources (like a fire extinguisher) and give instructions based on them.
-   **Static Info:** Includes quick-access information for major disasters (Volcano, Flood, etc.).
-   **Emergency Contacts:** A ready list of all important national emergency numbers.

## Technology Used
-   **HTML5/CSS3:** For the modern, responsive, and glassmorphism-style UI.
-   **JavaScript (ES6+):** To handle user input, `fetch` API calls, and DOM manipulation.
-   **Google's Gemini AI:** The core brain of the project, accessed via the official API.
